This live demo ramps up from basic concepts to recent research on spatially organized neuronal network models and plasticity with the simulator NEST (https://ebrains.eu/service/nest-simulator). In this workshop, we start by interacting with scripted PyNEST code and investigating the relationship between distance-dependent connectivity and spatially and temporally resolved patterns in spiking activity using Jupyter Notebooks. Then, we use PyNEST to explore how plasticity shapes the connectivity and function of neuronal networks.
